This is an updated repository for *The Pedantic Chess Engine* that was created when major refactoring and rewrites were undertaken. Much of the original [Pedantic](https://github.com/JoAnnP38/Pedantic) had been developed organically since its inception and its design had started to feel unweildy. This new repository represents a fresh start for moving forward.
